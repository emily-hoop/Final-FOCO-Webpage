    <h1>Get to know us! </h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Productivity Inc. was started by Brandon Bastille and Amelia Sholtze, both 2018 graduates of Boston University. The two met in a class for their shared computer science minor and found a common ground in their organizational styles.  Amelia was diagnosed at a young age with ADHD and Brandon is neurotypical.  Neither, in
        their whole college career, was ever able to find a planner and tracking app that worked for
        them. They tried Google Calendar, Apple’s to do lists on the notes app, reminders, and several
        other productivity apps like Asana, Productive, and Routinery. Both even tried expensive paper
        planners and self-care trackers, but nothing ever seemed to fully encompass the features they
        needed. So, they decided to start their own.  Productivity Inc. was founded on the idea that organizational resources can and should be found in one place.  The founders wanted a single app to do it all - planning, to-do lists, self-care trackers, health trackers, and much more.  In 2022, they came out with the first version of the PRO app and were met with astounding success.  Since then, the company has expanded to 22 incredible employees committed to making creative solutions for life's everyday problems.  Here at Productivity, we strive to make your life just a little bit easier, so that you can spend less time organizing, and more time in life's best moments.</p>
